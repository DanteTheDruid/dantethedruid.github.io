# TwitchIntegrationPlus Website - Deployment Guide

## 🚀 GitHub Pages Deployment

Your website is now configured to deploy automatically to GitHub Pages! Here's what has been set up:

### ✅ **Automated Deployment (Recommended)**

1. **Push to main branch** - The website will automatically build and deploy
2. **GitHub Actions workflow** handles the entire process
3. **No manual steps required** after the initial setup

### 📋 **Initial GitHub Pages Setup**

1. **Go to your repository on GitHub**
2. **Navigate to Settings → Pages**
3. **Set Source to "GitHub Actions"**
4. **That's it!** Your website will be available at: `https://dante-morrello.github.io/TwitchIntegrationPlusWebsite/`

### 🔧 **Manual Deployment (Alternative)**

⚠️ **Only use if you disable GitHub Actions deployment**

If you prefer manual deployment:

```bash
# Install dependencies (if not already done)
npm install

# Deploy manually (only use ONE deployment method)
npm run deploy-manual
```

**Important:** 
- If using manual deployment, **disable** the GitHub Actions workflow
- Set GitHub Pages source to "Deploy from a branch" → `gh-pages`
- **Don't use both methods simultaneously**

### 📁 **Project Structure for Deployment**

```

### ⚙️ **Configuration Details**

- **Base URL**: `/TwitchIntegrationPlusWebsite/` (configured in `vite.config.js`)
- **Build Output**: `dist/` directory

### 🎯 **Features That Work on GitHub Pages**

✅ **All your enhanced features will work:**

### 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

If deployment fails:
1. Check the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository
2. Ensure GitHub Pages is set to "GitHub Actions" source
3. Verify the base URL matches your repository name

#### **White Page Issue:**
If you see a blank white page:
1. **Open browser developer tools** (F12)
2. **Check the Console tab** for JavaScript errors
3. **Check the Network tab** for failed asset loads
4. **Verify the URL**: Should be `https://dantethedruid.github.io/TwitchIntegrationPlusWebsite/`
5. **Clear browser cache** and try again

Common fixes:
- Ensure GitHub Pages source is set to "GitHub Actions"
- Wait 5-10 minutes after deployment for changes to propagate
- Check that the repository name matches the base URL in `vite.config.js`

## 🐛 Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Fonts not loading
**Solution**: Fonts are loaded from Google Fonts CDN. If offline, the site falls back to system fonts.

### Issue: JavaScript features not working
**Solution**: Ensure JavaScript is enabled. All core functionality works without JS (progressive enhancement).

### Issue: Mobile navigation not working
**Solution**: The hamburger menu requires JavaScript. Test the responsive breakpoints.

## 📞 Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Test in an incognito/private window
3. Clear browser cache and reload
4. Open an issue on the GitHub repository

## ⚠️ **Avoiding Deployment Conflicts**

**Important:** GitHub Pages supports **TWO** deployment methods, but you should **ONLY USE ONE**:

### Method 1: GitHub Actions (Recommended) ✅
- **GitHub Pages Source**: "GitHub Actions"
- **How it works**: Automatically builds and deploys on push to main
- **Workflow file**: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- **Advantages**: Automatic, modern, handles build process

### Method 2: Manual Branch Deployment
- **GitHub Pages Source**: "Deploy from a branch" → `gh-pages`
- **How it works**: You run `npm run deploy-manual` locally
- **Advantages**: Full local control

### 🚨 **Conflict Prevention:**

**Never use both methods at the same time!** This would cause:
- Double deployments
- Potential overwrites
- Confusing deployment states

**To switch methods:**
1. **Going from Manual → GitHub Actions:**
   - Change GitHub Pages source to "GitHub Actions"
   - The workflow will handle everything

2. **Going from GitHub Actions → Manual:**
   - Disable the workflow: rename `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` to `.github/workflows/deploy.yml.disabled`
   - Change GitHub Pages source to "Deploy from a branch" → `gh-pages`
   - Use `npm run deploy-manual`

**Congratulations!** 🎉 Your TwitchIntegrationPlus website is ready for deployment and will provide an excellent resource for the Terraria streaming community!
